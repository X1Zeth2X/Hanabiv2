## New and Improved
* Added a bunch of features
* Easier to add new things
* Made to be highly customizable

## Dependencies & Requirements
Hanabi needs `python3+` to run and `PyYAML` for configuration file.
To install PyYAML simple run on a terminal.
* `pip3 install PyYAML` or `pip3 install PyYAML --user`
* `URxvt` is set as the default terminal. 
* This is mainly for `i3(WM/GAPS)` but I am planning to add support for other Window Managers soon.
